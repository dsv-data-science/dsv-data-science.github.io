### Description

The project is about automatic grading and assessment of electonic exams. The goal is to explore algorithmic solutions from natural language processing and machine learning for automating grading of free text questions. Special focus will be given on explainability and more concretely on highlighting parts of the text that contribute positively or negatively to the assessment. Our models will be built and assessed on both English and Swedish exam reports.

- **Objective 1: NLP models for quantion-based assesment.** We will develop transformer-based solutions (e.g., BERT) for distinghuishing high-scorer vs low-scorer answers. This will then be expanded to more fine-grained grade ranges, and eventually to the regression problem of predicting the actual grade.

- **Objective 2: Intra-exam and cross-exam evaluation.** We will further extend these models to be exam-based, topic-based, and eventually explore their transferability across different exams. Our intended final model will be an ensemble of question-based models for each topic. Finally, we will include the question text into the model as well as additional perfomance indicators of the student including the performance on earlier exams or other exam questions.

- **Objective 3: Ethics and explainability of automatic assessment.** With the intention of being GDPR compliant we will include explainability features in our models so that each grade recommendation will be coupled with an explanation indicating the parts of the text in the answer that are positively or negatively contributing affecting the grade decision. A final assessment report will be generated based on the overall score and performance in the exam functioning as general feedback.
