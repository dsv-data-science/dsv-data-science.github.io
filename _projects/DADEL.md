### Description

*In Swedish: Dataanalys för detektion av läkemedelseffekter (DADEL)*

The main goal of the project is to develop techniques and tools to support decision making and discovery of drug effects by analyzing patient records, drug registries, case safety reports and chemical compound data in the form of both structured and unstructured (free text) data.

The project will contribute with novel approaches to data mining and clinical text mining and develop a platform for large-scale analysis of massive, heterogeneous and continuously growing data sets.
