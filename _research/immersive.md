## Description

This research area focuses on the design, application and evaluation of machine learning methods to create behavioral models of users in digital environments. Our emphasis is the analysis of physiological time-series, motion trajectories, and game-play interactions within virtual reality (VR) environments, aiming to build models that perform real-time clustering and classification of subjective treats like user skill level, emotional states, or mental workload. We focus on VR technology because it is a medium to enhance traditional tasks with interactive immersive experiences, and with many applications on healthcare (physical and mental rehab), professional training, education, or marketing. 

## Frameworks
