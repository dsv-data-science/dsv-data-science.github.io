## Description

The basis of Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the interaction of an environment with an agent that learns how to manage the environment through direct experience.  The agent selects optimal actions for achieving an objective (e.g., minimizing spread), while responses to the agent's actions occur in the environment, including rewards. The output of an RL control algorithm is a policy, providing a set of actions to be taken when the system is in each state. This approach is beneficial for large decision spaces, where it is infeasible to visit each stateâ€“action pair many times. Deploying such methods in a real outbreak requires parallelization of simulation models, and the RL algorithms themselves may require tuning of hyperparameters. Our research direction in this area is to focus on off-policy solutions where the policies include ordered sets of actions.
