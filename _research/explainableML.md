## Description

Another focus of our research within data science is on methods for generating interpretable and explainable models, e.g., actionable feature tweaking, locally explainable models, and rule learning. Interpretability has gained more attention in recent years, since data science methods and models have started to be used to larger extend in both industry and society as a whole. It can be quantified at the model level, i.e., by providing a description of the whole model to the human or by instances, i.e., explaining for each decision the reasons and motivate behind the decision.  There exist lot of aspects on models that relate to interpretability, such as model stability and size, dimensionality reduction, and visualization.
